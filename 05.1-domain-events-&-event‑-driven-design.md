## Module 5: Domain Events & Event‑Driven Design

### Theory

---

### 1. What Is a Domain Event?

A **Domain Event** is a record of something significant that has happened within the business domain. Unlike technical or infrastructure events, domain events capture *business‑level* occurrences (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `CustomerRegistered`) and are named in the past tense to reflect that they have already occurred ([Medium][1], [Frank on Software][2]). They serve as an explicit, immutable fact in your model, providing both an audit log and a decoupling mechanism for side‑effects.

---

### 2. Modeling & Naming Conventions

* **Immutability**: Once created, a domain event’s data never changes; it represents a historical fact.
* **Payload Design**: Include only the minimal context required for downstream handlers (e.g., aggregate ID, timestamp, relevant value objects). Avoid over‑communication to keep messages lightweight.
* **Naming**: Use clear, business‑centric past‑tense names (e.g., `ProductShipped`, not `ShipProductEvent`) to align with the **Ubiquitous Language** ([martinfowler.com][3]).

---

### 3. Dispatching & Handling Events

* **In‑Process Dispatch**: Inside an Aggregate, raise events via a domain dispatcher or collector. After a transaction, a domain service or application layer pushes these events to handlers.
* **Framework Integration**: In Laravel, you can map domain events to Laravel Events/Listeners or use a dedicated domain‑event bus (e.g., via [Laravel Events](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/events)).
* **Side‑Effects**: Handlers (listeners) react to events by executing side‑effects such as sending emails, updating read models, or enqueuing messages—without muddying domain logic ([Microsoft Learn][4]).

---

### 4. Transactional Boundaries & Consistency

* **One Transaction = One Aggregate**: Follow the rule that each transaction modifies exactly one Aggregate, ensuring strict consistency within that boundary.
* **Eventual Consistency Across Aggregates**: To coordinate multiple Aggregates, publish domain events that other contexts consume asynchronously, embracing eventual consistency rather than multi‑aggregate transactions ([Microsoft Learn][4]).
* **Transactional Outbox**: To guarantee reliable event publication, use the Outbox pattern—store events in the same DB transaction as your Aggregate change, then separate process publishes them.

---

### 5. Integration & Integration Events

* **Integration Events**: When events cross bounded contexts or services, repackage them as *integration events*, potentially enriching payloads to meet external requirements (e.g., service‑wide schemas).
* **Anti‑Corruption Layer**: Prevent leaking internal domain models by translating domain events into integration events at context boundaries.

---

### 6. Sagas & Process Managers

Long‑running business processes that span multiple steps or Aggregates can be orchestrated via:

* **Sagas** (Orchestration style): A central coordinator listens to events and issues commands or compensating actions.
* **Process Managers** (Choreography style): Each service reacts to events and emits further events, propagating the workflow in a decentralized manner ([microservices.io][5]).

---

### 7. Reliability, Idempotency & Error Handling

* **Idempotent Handlers**: Design event handlers so they can safely reprocess the same event (e.g., guard against duplicate messages).
* **Retries & Dead‑Letter Queues**: Use middleware or queue features to retry failed handlers and route poison messages to a dead‑letter queue for manual inspection.
* **Monitoring**: Track event publication and consumption metrics to detect back‑pressure or failures early.

---

By mastering domain events and event‑driven design, you’ll achieve a highly decoupled architecture where business changes propagate through clear, audit‑friendly channels—allowing services and contexts to evolve independently while maintaining consistency across your system.
