## Module 3: Repositories & the Persistence Boundary

### Theory

---

### 1. Purpose of the Repository Pattern

Repositories serve as an **abstraction layer** between the Domain and the data‑access mechanism, encapsulating all logic needed to retrieve and persist domain objects. They allow Domain code to remain ignorant of whether data lives in MySQL, MongoDB, a web service, or an in‑memory cache—promoting **persistence ignorance** and keeping high‑level business rules free of low‑level concerns .

---

### 2. Repository Interface Definition

* **Interface-Driven Design**: Define a `XxxRepositoryInterface` in the Domain layer that exposes only the methods the Domain needs (e.g., `save()`, `find()`, `all()`, `delete()`).
* **Interface Segregation**: Avoid “fat” interfaces; group related operations into focused contracts (e.g., a `ReadModelRepository` with only query methods, separate from a `WriteModelRepository`).
* **Return Types**: Repositories return Domain Entities or collections thereof, never raw database records or framework-specific objects.

---

### 3. Persistence Ignorance & Mapping

* **Plain Old PHP Objects (POPOs)**: Domain Entities and Value Objects should not import or extend Eloquent, Query Builder, or any framework classes.
* **Data Mapping**: Implement mapping logic in the Infrastructure layer to convert between Persistence Models (e.g., Eloquent models) and Domain Entities. This can be done manually or via tools like \[Laravel Data Transfer Objects] or dedicated mappers.

---

### 4. Infrastructure Implementations

* **Adapters (Ports & Adapters)**: Each repository interface is paired with one or more concrete adapters—e.g., `EloquentTaskRepository`, `DoctrineOrderRepository`, or a `CachedOrderRepository` that delegates to another adapter.
* **Service Container Binding**: Use Laravel’s IOC container to bind interface to implementation, allowing easy swapping or decorating of repository behavior.
* **Anti‑Corruption Layer**: When integrating with legacy schemas or external data sources, wrap their models behind your repository interfaces to prevent “leaking” foreign models into your Domain.

---

### 5. Transaction Management: Unit of Work vs. Transaction Script

* **Unit of Work (UoW)** (Fowler): Tracks changes to multiple objects and commits them as a single transaction—ideal when you need atomicity across several repository operations .
* **Transaction Script**: A procedural approach where each use case explicitly begins and commits a transaction around repository calls—simpler but can lead to duplication of transaction logic.
* **Laravel Context**: By default, each HTTP request can wrap operations in a transaction via `DB::transaction()`, but complex business workflows may benefit from a UoW implementation.

---

### 6. Query Patterns & Performance

* **Query Objects**: Encapsulate complex read logic in objects that build and execute queries—keeps repository interfaces clean.
* **Specification Pattern**: Define business‑rule snippets (specifications) that can be composed to filter or select Entities—allows repositories to accept `Specification` objects and translate them to queries.
* **Projections & Read Models**: For read‑heavy scenarios, consider separate read models (denormalized data or materialized views) accessed via dedicated query repositories, decoupling reads from the write‑optimized domain model.

---

### 7. Testing Repositories

* **In‑Memory Implementations**: Create lightweight, in‑memory repository adapters that implement your interfaces for fast, isolated unit tests of Application and Domain logic.
* **Mocking & Stubbing**: Use PHPUnit mocks or prophecy to stub out repository interfaces in Application Service tests.
* **Integration Tests**: Exercise the real Infrastructure implementations against an SQLite in‑memory database to catch mapping or schema mismatches early.

---

### 8. Key Benefits & Trade‑Offs

* **Decoupling**: Changes to the database schema or data‑access library have zero impact on Domain code.
* **Testability**: Business rules can be verified without spinning up a database.
* **Complexity Overhead**: Introducing interfaces and mapping layers adds boilerplate; evaluate whether the added abstraction yields sufficient long‑term maintainability in your project.

With this theory foundation, you have a clear understanding of **how** and **why** to define repository interfaces, where to place mapping logic, how to manage transactions, and how to ensure your Domain remains pure and highly testable. In the next hands‑on session, we’ll implement these patterns in Laravel 12 step by step.
