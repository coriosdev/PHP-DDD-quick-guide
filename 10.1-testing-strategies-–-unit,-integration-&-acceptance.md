## Module 10: Testing Strategies – Unit, Integration & Acceptance

### 1. The Test Pyramid

Martin Fowler’s **Practical Test Pyramid** illustrates how to balance confidence, speed, and maintenance cost across test types:

```text
      ┌───────────────┐
      │ Acceptance    │  ← few, slowest
      ├───────────────┤
      │ Integration   │  ← more, moderate speed
      ├───────────────┤
      │ Unit          │  ← many, fastest
      └───────────────┘
```

* **Unit Tests** form the bulk: isolated, fast, and focused on single classes or methods.
* **Integration Tests** verify interactions between multiple components (e.g., repositories + database).
* **Acceptance Tests** (end‑to‑end) drive the application from the outside in—through HTTP or UI—to ensure the system meets business requirements. ([martinfowler.com][1], [martinfowler.com][2])

---

### 2. Unit Testing

* **Scope**: Test a single “unit” of behavior (a class or method) in isolation.
* **Isolation**: Use mocks, stubs, or in‑memory fakes for all external dependencies (DB, HTTP, file system).
* **Tools**:

  * **PHPUnit**: framework for writing and running tests.
  * **Mockery** or built‑in PHPUnit mocks for stubbing collaborators.
* **Best Practices**:

  * Keep tests small and focused on one behavior.
  * Avoid touching the database or network.
  * Use data providers for multiple scenarios.
  * Prefer the **classic style** (sociable) for simple units, **mockist style** for rich collaborations ([Stack Overflow][3], [Software Engineering Stack Exchange][4]).

---

### 3. Integration Testing

* **Scope**: Verify that components work together correctly (e.g., your repository’s mapping, application services with real DB).
* **Real Infrastructure**: Use an in‑memory SQLite or Dockerized service pipelines to run against real databases or services.
* **Laravel Support**:

  * `RefreshDatabase` or `DatabaseMigrations` traits to reset state.
  * Factories to generate test data.
* **Goals**:

  * Catch offenses that unit tests miss (schema mismatches, incorrect SQL).
  * Ensure transaction management and ORM mappings behave as expected. ([Binarcode][5], [martinfowler.com][2]).

---

### 4. Acceptance (End‑to‑End) Testing

* **Scope**: Test the entire system stack from the user’s perspective—through HTTP endpoints or a browser.
* **Tools in Laravel**:

  * **Feature Tests** (Laravel’s HTTP testing).
  * **Laravel Dusk** for real browser interactions (JavaScript, UI flows).
* **Characteristics**:

  * Slowest tests, so use sparingly for critical business workflows.
  * Validate routing, middleware, controllers, views, and JavaScript if using Dusk.
* **Best Practices**:

  * Maintain a small suite of acceptance tests covering core user journeys.
  * Avoid overlap with integration tests—focus on high‑value scenarios. ([Laracasts][6]).

---

### 5. Test Doubles & Styles

* **Fakes**: In‑memory implementations (e.g., an in‑memory repository) for faster integration/unit tests.
* **Stubs**: Pre‑programmed responses (e.g., HTTP client stub).
* **Mocks**: Verify interactions (method calls, arguments).
* **Spies**: Record information about calls without strict expectations.
* **Classic vs. Mockist**: Classic tests exercise real collaborators where possible; mockist tests isolate heavily with mocks. Use the style that yields clearer, more maintainable tests ([Stack Overflow][3]).

---

### 6. Data Management & Isolation

* **Factories & Seeders**: Create domain‑relevant test data quickly.
* **Database Transactions**: Wrap tests in transactions to rollback state automatically.
* **Avoid Shared State**: Each test should set up its own data, ensuring tests can run in any order.
* **Minimal Data**: Seed only what’s needed to exercise the behavior under test ([Reddit][7]).

---

### 7. CI/CD Considerations

* **Speed vs. Coverage**: Prioritize unit tests for rapid feedback; run slower integration/acceptance tests in nightly or gated pipelines.
* **Parallelization**: Use tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab runners to parallelize test suites.
* **Flakiness Management**: Isolate slow or fragile tests; quarantine or refactor them to maintain confidence.

---

### 8. Organizing Tests in Laravel

```
tests/
├── Unit/           ← unit tests, uses in-memory fakes
├── Feature/        ← integration & HTTP tests, RefreshDatabase
└── DuskTestCase.php ← acceptance tests with browser automation
```

* Align folder structure with your codebase modules.
* Name tests to clearly indicate scope and intent (e.g., `CreateOrderServiceTest`, `OrderApiTest`, `UserLoginDuskTest`).

---

By applying these strategies—balancing fast, focused unit tests with broader integration and acceptance tests—you’ll achieve high confidence in your Laravel application while keeping turnaround time and maintenance overhead in check.
