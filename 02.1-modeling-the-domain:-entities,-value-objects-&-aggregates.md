Below is the **theory** section for **Module 2: Modeling the Domain – Entities, Value Objects & Aggregates**. It covers every subtopic you need, with authoritative citations.

## Theory

### 1. Core Building Blocks in DDD

Domain‑Driven Design (DDD) defines three fundamental tactical building blocks to model your domain:

1. **Entities**
2. **Value Objects**
3. **Aggregates**

These work together to express intent, enforce invariants, and maintain consistency.

### 2. Entities

* **Definition**: An Entity is a domain object defined primarily by its *identity* rather than its attributes. Two Entity instances are considered distinct even if all their properties match, so long as their identities differ.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Mutable: its state can change over time.
  * Lifecycle: it has a distinct lifecycle (creation, modification, deletion).
  * Identity: often represented by a surrogate ID (UUID, database key) or natural key.
* **Role**: Encapsulate core business concepts that require tracking across operations and time.
* **Example**: A `Customer` in an e‑commerce system, tracked by a unique `customerId`. ([Jannik Wempe][1])

---

### 3. Value Objects

* **Definition**: A Value Object is an immutable type that is defined *solely* by its attributes. Two Value Objects with the same attribute values are interchangeable.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Immutable: once created, its state never changes.
  * No identity: equality is structural, not identity‑based.
  * Valid at all times: typically validated at construction.
* **Benefits**:

  * Simpler reasoning—no identity tracking.
  * Easier to cache, share, or reuse safely.
  * Can encapsulate domain logic (e.g., currency arithmetic, formatting).
* **Example**: An `Address` or a `Money(amount, currency)` object. ([Medium][2])

---

### 4. Aggregates & Aggregate Roots

* **Aggregate**: A cluster of Entities and Value Objects treated as a single consistency boundary for data changes.
* **Aggregate Root**: A designated Entity that is the sole entry point for external interaction with the Aggregate. All modifications to any part of the Aggregate must go through the root.
* **Key Rules** (Vaughn Vernon’s guidelines):

  1. **Single Root**: Exactly one Aggregate Root per Aggregate; only it may be referenced externally.
  2. **Transactional Boundary**: All changes within the Aggregate must be atomic—either all succeed or none do.
  3. **Invariants Enforcement**: Invariants span Entities and VOs inside the boundary and must be enforced by the root.
  4. **Reference by ID**: Other Aggregates should hold only the root’s identity, not object references to internal members. ([dddcommunity.org][3], [InfoQ][4])

---

### 5. Designing Aggregates for Consistency and Performance

* **Size Matters**: Keep Aggregates *as small as possible* to avoid contention and excessive locking; favor eventual consistency across contexts if needed.
* **Navigability**: Internal members can reference each other freely, but external code only deals with the root’s API.
* **Snapshot vs. Replay** (advanced): In Event‑Sourced models, Aggregates can be rehydrated by replaying events or via periodic snapshots.

---

### 6. Putting It All Together

* **Composition**: Entities can own Value Objects; Collections of these form Aggregates.
* **Ubiquitous Language**: Your code names (classes, methods) should reflect the domain language so that `Order`, `OrderLine`, `Money`, and `OrderPlaced` map directly to domain concepts.
* **Invariants & Encapsulation**: All business rules—e.g., “an order’s total must be ≥ 0” or “a paid invoice cannot be modified”—are contained within Aggregates.

With these core concepts in place, you have the vocabulary and rules to model any domain in a decoupled, expressive, and maintainable way. In the next hands‑on session, we’ll implement Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates step by step in Laravel 12.
