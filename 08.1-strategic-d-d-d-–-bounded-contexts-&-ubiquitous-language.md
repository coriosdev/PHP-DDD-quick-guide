## Module 8: Strategic DDD – Bounded Contexts & Ubiquitous Language

### Theory

---

### 1. Strategic DDD Overview

Strategic Domain‑Driven Design focuses on the high‑level organization of a system by aligning software structure with the business’s language and boundaries. Its goal is to manage complexity in large domains by partitioning the model and coordinating interactions among parts .

---

### 2. Subdomain Classification

Understanding the nature of each part of the business helps prioritize and organize effort:

* **Core Subdomain**

  * The company’s primary value‑creating area.
  * Requires the most investment, custom modeling, and deep domain expertise.
* **Supporting Subdomain**

  * Enables the core subdomain but is not itself differentiating.
  * Can often be implemented with off‑the‑shelf or generic solutions.
* **Generic Subdomain**

  * Common business capabilities (e.g., authentication, billing).
  * Ideal candidates for third‑party products or shared services. .

---

### 3. Bounded Contexts

A **Bounded Context** defines an explicit boundary within which a particular model applies consistently:

* **Model Autonomy**: Each context has its own conceptual model, terminology, and codebase.
* **Context Boundary**: Can map to a microservice, a module, a library, or even a team.
* **Isolation**: Changes in one context’s model don’t ripple uncontrolled into others.
* **Context Diagram**: Visualizes contexts and their relationships. .

---

### 4. Context Mapping

Describes how Bounded Contexts relate and integrate:

* **Partnership**: Two teams work closely, sharing an upstream‑downstream relationship with collaborative model agreements.
* **Shared Kernel**: A small kernel of code or model is shared between contexts; both must coordinate on changes.
* **Customer–Supplier**: One context (supplier) provides services; the other (customer) conforms to the supplier’s model.
* **Conformist**: The downstream context has no influence over the upstream model and must adapt.
* **Anti‑Corruption Layer (ACL)**: Translates between models to prevent leakage of foreign concepts.
* **Open Host Service**: The upstream context exposes a stable interface for downstream use. .

---

### 5. Ubiquitous Language

A shared, rigorous language used by both domain experts and developers:

* **Definition**: Terms in code (class names, method names, events) mirror the business’s terminology exactly.
* **Evolution**: Ubiquitous Language grows through domain conversations, examples, and model refinements.
* **Alignment**: Ensures that code, documentation, and spoken discussions use the same vocabulary, reducing translation errors. .

---

### 6. Integration Patterns & Anti‑Corruption

To coordinate behavior across contexts without polluting models:

* **Anti‑Corruption Layer (ACL)**

  * A façade or adapter that translates external models/messages into the internal model’s terms.
  * Prevents external changes from corrupting the internal domain.
* **Published Language**

  * A shared protocol or schema (e.g., JSON contract, protobuf) used for integration events or services.
  * Serves as a stable “lingua franca.”
* **Open Host Service**

  * A well‑defined API exposed by one context, with clear versioning and backwards compatibility guarantees.
* **Shared Kernel**

  * A small, collaboratively managed subset of code or model shared between two contexts, requiring joint governance. .

---

### 7. Benefits & Considerations

* **Benefits**

  * Manages complexity by clear separation of models.
  * Aligns technical structure with organizational boundaries and business capabilities.
  * Reduces coupling and enables independent evolution.
* **Challenges**

  * Requires strong cross‑team communication and governance.
  * Overhead in maintaining translation layers (ACLs, shared kernels).
  * Potential duplication of similar concepts across contexts.

With this theory in hand, you understand how to partition your system into meaningful contexts, speak a unified language with domain experts, and choose the right integration patterns to keep models clean and decoupled.
