## Module 9: Infrastructure Adapters & Anti‑Corruption Layers

### Theory

---

### 1. The Adapter (Ports & Adapters) Pattern

* **Purpose**: Decouple your Domain from external systems (databases, web services, message queues, UI frameworks) by isolating calls behind **ports** (interfaces) and **adapters** (implementations) ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Ports**: Interfaces defined in the Domain or Application layer that describe required operations (e.g., `PaymentGatewayInterface`, `EmailClientInterface`).
* **Adapters**: Concrete implementations in the Infrastructure layer that satisfy those ports by invoking framework‑ or vendor‑specific APIs (e.g., Stripe SDK, SMTP libraries).
* **Benefit**: Swappable implementations—replace Eloquent with Doctrine, or a real SMTP adapter with a mock—without touching core business logic.

### 2. Anti‑Corruption Layer (ACL)

* **Definition**: A specialized adapter layer that **translates** between an external system’s model and your Domain’s model, preventing “leakage” of foreign concepts into your ubiquitous language ([Microsoft Learn][2], [Software Engineering Stack Exchange][3]).
* **When to Use**:

  * Integrating with legacy applications or third‑party services whose data schemas or semantics differ from your domain.
  * Contexts with different models in a Context Map (e.g., Customer–Supplier, Conformist scenarios).
* **Responsibilities**:

  1. **Mapping** payloads and identifiers to your Value Objects and Entities.
  2. **Validation & Filtering** of incoming data to enforce your invariants.
  3. **Translation** of your domain commands/events into the external system’s expected calls.
* **Trade‑Offs**: Adds latency and extra maintenance code, but protects domain purity and reduces coupling ([AWS Documentation][4]).

### 3. Common Adapter Types

| Adapter Type         | Role                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway / Client** | Synchronous API client (HTTP, gRPC) behind a port.          |
| **Repository**       | Data‑access adapter implementing repository interfaces.     |
| **Message Producer** | Publishes domain events/commands to queues or buses.        |
| **Message Consumer** | Listens to external events and maps them to domain events.  |
| **Facade**           | Simplified interface aggregating multiple lower‑level APIs. |

### 4. Designing Robust Infrastructure Adapters

* **Resilience Patterns**: Incorporate retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts at the adapter boundary to guard against transient failures.
* **Idempotency**: Ensure adapters can safely retry operations without unintended side effects.
* **Logging & Metrics**: Record adapter calls, latencies, and errors to aid monitoring and troubleshooting.
* **Configuration**: Externalize endpoints, credentials, and timeouts via environment or configuration files—never hard‑code them.

---

### 5. Testing Adapters & ACLs

* **Unit Tests**: Mock external clients/responses to exercise adapter logic and mapping, verifying that ports receive correctly translated calls.
* **Contract Tests**: For ACLs against third‑party APIs, use consumer‑driven contract tests (e.g., Pact) to ensure your translations remain correct as external contracts evolve.
* **Integration Tests**: Spin up real or simulated external services (e.g., using WireMock or localstack) to validate end‑to‑end interactions.
* **In‑Memory Fakes**: Provide in‑process fake adapters that implement the same port interfaces for fast testing of application and domain logic.

---

### 6. Anti‑Corruption Layer in Context Mapping

Within a **Context Map** (Eric Evans):

* **Customer–Supplier**: ACL protects the supplier context from imposing its model on the customer.
* **Conformist**: When change in the upstream model is unlikely, an ACL shields your downstream model from instability.
* **Shared Kernel**: By contrast, a small shared kernel may be used when two teams agree to co‑manage a subset of the model—ACLs aren’t needed for that shared part ([Wikipedia][5]).

---

### 7. Key Benefits & Trade‑Offs

* **Benefits**:

  * Maintains **domain purity** and **ubiquitous language**.
  * Enables **technology independence** and **clean testing**.
  * Provides a clear place to handle **error translation**, **fallbacks**, and **protocol differences**.
* **Trade‑Offs**:

  * Additional boilerplate and maintenance.
  * Potential performance overhead.
  * Requires discipline to keep ACLs thin and focused.

---

With these principles, you can confidently design your Laravel 12 application so that all external interactions are cleanly segregated behind adapters and ACLs—shielding your core Domain from volatility and ensuring maintainability.
