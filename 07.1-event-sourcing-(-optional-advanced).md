# **7. Event Sourcing (Optional Advanced)**



**Module Type**: Theory
**Level**: Advanced
**Required Precedents**: Domain Events, CQRS

## 🧠 What Is Event Sourcing?

**Event Sourcing** is a software architecture pattern where **state changes** in a system are not persisted as the latest value of an entity, but instead as a **sequence of events** that represent every state transition over time.

> **Traditional way**: Store current state (e.g., a user record).
> **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes (e.g., `UserRegistered`, `UserEmailChanged`, `UserDeactivated`).

## 🎯 Goals of Event Sourcing

| Goal                        | Explanation                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Auditability**          | Every change is recorded as an immutable fact.                     |
| 🔁 **Replayability**        | Rebuild any state by replaying all events.                         |
| 🧪 **Testing-friendly**     | You can verify exact historical behavior.                          |
| ⚡ **Decoupled Projection**  | State (read models) can be built in various forms, asynchronously. |
| ⏳ **Time-travel debugging** | You can “rewind” the system to any moment.                         |

## ⚙️ Core Concepts

### 1. **Event Store**

A database or system where all events are stored **in order**. This is your **source of truth**.

### 2. **Aggregate**

A domain object that emits events and can rebuild its state from a series of past events.

### 3. **Event**

An immutable fact. E.g., `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentReceived`.
Stored with metadata: timestamp, version, actor, payload, etc.

### 4. **Snapshot (Optional)**

A point-in-time snapshot of an aggregate to improve performance when rehydrating from many events.

### 5. **Projectors**

Build read models (queries) from emitted events. These are **event listeners** that create or update read-only views.

## 🏗️ How It Works (Conceptually)

```text
Command: "Change Email"
↓
Aggregate loads past events → Rebuilds state
↓
Applies business rules
↓
Produces Event: EmailChanged
↓
Event stored in Event Store
↓
Event is published to:
  - Read model projector
  - External services
```

## 🧩 Event Sourcing vs Domain Events

| Topic      | Domain Events                | Event Sourcing                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | Notify other parts of system | Store system state transitions              |
| Optional   | Yes                          | No — it's the core persistence mechanism    |
| Storage    | Usually not persisted        | Events **are** persisted as source of truth |
| Replayable | Not by default               | Yes — replay is a feature                   |

## 🧱 Data Modeling Shift

| Traditional Table   | Event Store                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `users` table       | Stream of `UserRegistered`, `UserRenamed`, etc. |
| Column = field      | Event = change                                  |
| Row = current state | Replay = final state                            |

---

## 🔄 Event Rehydration

```php
$events = $eventStore->getEventsFor(UserId::fromString('abc-123'));

$user = new UserAggregate();
$user->replay($events);

// $user is now in latest state, just from events
```

## ⚠️ Trade-offs and Challenges

| Challenge                    | Explanation                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚧 **Complexity**            | Requires deeper architectural investment          |
| 🐌 **Performance**           | Replay can be slow (requires snapshots)           |
| ❗ **Event versioning**       | Changing old events requires migration logic      |
| 🔄 **Eventually consistent** | Read models may be async, not strongly consistent |

---

## 🛠️ When to Use Event Sourcing?

✅ Ideal for systems that:

* Require **audit trails**
* Have **complex workflows** and many state transitions
* Need **replay/debugging** capabilities
* Work well with **CQRS**
* Tolerate **eventual consistency**

🚫 Not ideal when:

* You only need simple CRUD
* Consistency must be immediate
* You lack tooling/team experience

## 🏁 Summary

| Topic           | Takeaway                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pattern         | Store every change as an event            |
| Benefits        | Auditability, Replay, Debugging           |
| Core Components | Aggregate, Event Store, Projector         |
| Works well with | CQRS and DDD                              |
| Challenges      | Event versioning, complexity, performance |
