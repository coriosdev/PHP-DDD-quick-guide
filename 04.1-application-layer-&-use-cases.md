## Module 4: Application Layer & Use Cases

### Theory

---

### 1. Role & Purpose of the Application Layer

The Application (or Use‑Case) layer sits between the **Domain** and the **Interface Adapters**, orchestrating business rules to fulfill specific user‑driven workflows. Its responsibilities are:

* Encapsulate **application‑specific** business logic—rules that may change when requirements change, without touching core domain policies ([Alexander Molochko][1]).
* Define clear **use cases** (also called **interactors**) as single, atomic operations (e.g., “PlaceOrder,” “RegisterUser”) that represent user intentions ([Stack Overflow][2]).
* Coordinate repositories, domain entities, value objects, and external services (email, SMS, payment gateways).

---

### 2. Use Cases vs. Services vs. Interactors

* **Use Case / Interactor**: A class or component that implements one business operation. It:

  1. Receives an input port (method call with a DTO)
  2. Interacts with repositories to load Entities
  3. Invokes Entity methods to apply domain rules
  4. Persists changes via repositories
  5. Returns an output DTO or invokes an output port (e.g., presenter) ([marcduerst.com][3])

* **Service Layer**: A broader term often used interchangeably, but in Clean Architecture each service should map to a single use case to satisfy **Single Responsibility**.

---

### 3. Input & Output Ports (DTOs)

* **Input DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects): Immutable objects carrying only the data needed to execute a use case (e.g., `CreateOrderRequest`). They decouple controller/request objects from use‑case signatures.
* **Output DTOs**: Return only the data needed by the presentation layer, preventing leakage of domain Entities or persistence details.
* **Ports**: Interfaces defining the input and output contracts. Controllers implement the input port, presenters implement the output port ([Software Engineering Stack Exchange][4]).

---

### 4. Orchestration Flow

1. **Controller / Adapter** receives an HTTP/CLI event.
2. Validates and maps request data into an **Input DTO**.
3. Invokes the **Use Case** via its input port.
4. Use Case:

   * Loads or creates Entities via **Repository** interfaces
   * Applies domain rules by calling Entity methods
   * Collaborates with other services or external systems
   * Persists changes atomically (optionally within a transaction)
5. Produces an **Output DTO**, or calls an **Output Port** (presenter) to format results.
6. **Controller**/**Presenter** maps the Output DTO to JSON, HTML, etc.

---

### 5. Keeping Controllers Thin

Controllers should:

* Handle HTTP concerns (validation, authentication)
* Map to/from DTOs
* Delegate all business logic to Use Cases
  This ensures that application logic lives in testable, framework‑agnostic services ([milanjovanovic.tech][5]).

---

### 6. Exception Handling & Error Translation

* **Domain Exceptions**: Thrown by Entities or Value Objects for invariant violations (e.g., “Cannot pay an order with zero total”).
* **Application Exceptions**: Use Cases catch domain exceptions and translate them into meaningful application errors or output‑port callbacks.
* **Adapter Layer Handling**: Controllers catch application exceptions and convert them to HTTP responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).

---

### 7. Testing Use Cases

* **Unit Tests**: Instantiate Use Case classes with **mocked** or **in‑memory** repository implementations; assert correct Output DTO or raised exception.
* **Integration Tests**: Wire real repository adapters (e.g., SQLite in‑memory) and verify end‑to‑end use case behavior.
* **Edge Cases**: Ensure validation, error translation, and transactional behavior are covered.

With this theoretical groundwork, you understand how to structure your Laravel application so that all business workflows live as isolated, testable Use Case classes—keeping controllers and adapters light, and ensuring a clean separation of concerns. In the next hands‑on session, we’ll implement a sample use case in Laravel 12, complete with DTOs, service bindings, and tests.
