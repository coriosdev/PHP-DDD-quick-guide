## Module 6: CQRS (Command–Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Theory

---

### 1. Origins & Definition

Command–Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) extends Bertrand Meyer’s **Command–Query Separation** principle (CQS) to service and system architecture. In CQS, methods are split into **commands** (which mutate state) and **queries** (which return data without side effects). CQRS applies this at the architectural level by providing separate models—and often separate data stores—for reads and writes ([Wikipedia][1], [Wikipedia][2]).

---

### 2. Commands vs. Queries

* **Commands** represent intent to change system state (e.g., `CreateOrder`, `UpdateProfile`). They:

  * Are named imperatively (e.g., `PlaceOrderCommand`).
  * May include validation but never return data beyond success/failure.
* **Queries** retrieve data without side‑effects (e.g., `GetOrderDetailsQuery`, `ListProductsQuery`). They:

  * Return DTOs or read models optimized for display or reporting.
  * Must not alter system state (with the sole exception of safe logging).

By decoupling read and write operations, each side can evolve independently, optimized for its own concerns ([martinfowler.com][3]).

---

### 3. Command & Query Handlers

* **Handlers** are the implementation of commands and queries:

  * **Command Handlers** load/write domain entities or invoke use‑case services, coordinate transactions, and dispatch domain events.
  * **Query Handlers** execute read‑only logic against projections or read‑optimized models, often bypassing the domain layer for performance.
* **Input/Output Contracts**: Each handler implements a well‑defined interface (e.g., `handle(PlaceOrderCommand): void`, `handle(ListOrdersQuery): OrderListDTO[]`), facilitating testability and adherence to the **Single Responsibility Principle** ([Medium][4]).

---

### 4. Read Models & Projections

* **Read Models** (also called **Projections** or **Views**) are denormalized data representations tailored for specific query use cases (e.g., tables aggregating sales by region).
* **Projection Builders** listen to domain events (or subscribe to the write model) to update read models asynchronously, enabling high‑performance queries against large datasets ([Confluent][5]).
* This separation allows scaling reads independently (e.g., separate read database, caching layers) and simplifies complex reporting queries that would be cumbersome against normalized domain tables.

---

### 5. Consistency & Transactions

* **Strong Consistency Within Write Model**: All command handling operations occur in a transaction against the write database, ensuring the domain’s invariants.
* **Eventual Consistency Across Read Model**: Read models may lag behind the write model as projections update asynchronously—acceptable for use cases tolerant of slight staleness. Implement patterns like **Transactional Outbox** to reliably publish events in the same transaction as writes ([Confluent][5]).

---

### 6. When to Apply CQRS

**Benefits**:

* Enables independent scaling of reads and writes.
* Simplifies complex queries and reporting.
* Facilitates implementing **Event Sourcing** or **Audit Logging** alongside.
  **Trade‑Offs**:
* Increases architectural complexity and infrastructure footprint.
* Requires careful handling of eventual consistency and race conditions.
* May be overkill for simple CRUD applications ([martinfowler.com][3]).

---

### 7. Relationship with Event‑Driven Design

CQRS often pairs with **Event Sourcing**, where commands produce events that are stored as the system of record, and projections rebuild read models from those events. However, CQRS itself does *not* mandate Event Sourcing—you can use traditional state persistence for the write model and still separate reads and writes ([itenium.be][6]).

---

### 8. Testing Strategies

* **Command Handler Tests**: Use in‑memory or mock repositories to assert that commands enforce domain rules, modify state correctly, and dispatch expected events.
* **Query Handler Tests**: Populate read models (e.g., seed in‑memory tables) and verify queries return correct DTOs.
* **Integration Tests**: Verify end‑to‑end behavior, including projection updates, eventual consistency flows, and transaction handling.

---

With these principles in place, CQRS empowers you to build systems where write logic remains focused on business invariants, and read logic scales and evolves without impacting core domain operations.
